As a final project for my Database Management class, my group and I decided to analyze NFL statistics and front offices from 2009-2019 using SQL. The project site is linked [here](https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/nfl_data_project/nfl-data-analysis/home?session=100636108704812), where you can find our analysis, visualizations, and tables.
